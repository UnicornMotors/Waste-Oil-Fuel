>Vacuum oil collection system
>Vacuum Collection is the Best
>Because everything is sucked into a tank, waste oil is best collected with a vacuum system similar to the type used in a septic tank truck. This doesn't mean you need a sewage truck to collect oil. Small systems are easy to build and will fit in the back of a truck or on a small trailer. Plans and a complete description of vacuum systems may be found in our book:

>“Alternative Energy Secrets” and a short vacuum oil collection video may be seen on YouTube.
